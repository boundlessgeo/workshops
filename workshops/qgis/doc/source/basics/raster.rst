Raster data
===========

#. We can add some raster data by clicking the |raster| icon next to the layer list.

#. Select the ``dem_90m.zip`` file in the ``qgis\downloads`` directory.

#. Save the file as ``dem_90m.tif`` in the ``qgis\data`` directory with the correct **EPSG:2163** CRS and a resolution of ``300`` by ``300``.

#. Repeat the conversion process with ``gaplandcov_WY.img`` but leave the resolution as the default.
