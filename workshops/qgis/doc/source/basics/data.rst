Loading data
============

We can now start adding some of our data to the *Antelope range analysis* project.

#. The QGIS user interface shows a list of all layers that have been loaded into our project, and currently, our list is empty.

      List of layers

#. Click the |vector| icon next to the layer list to add a vector layer.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Browse` button to open a file dialog.

#. Find the ``Antelope_HuntAreasHerdUnits.zip`` file in your ``downloads`` directory.

#. Click :guilabel:`Open` to load the file into your project.

      Antelope herds layer

   .. note:: QGIS will randomly assign a colour to the vector layer so what you see will probably not match the screenshot exactly.

#. Repeat the process for the ``surfgeol_500k.shp`` file (not ``surfgeol_500k.zip``). After adding this layer, however, you may not see any new data appear in the main QGIS panel.

#. Right click on the **surfgeol_500k** item in the list of layers and select :guilabel:`Zoom to Layer Extent`. The view should now display this layer if it didn't already.

      Surficial geology layer

Both layers contain data for the state of Wyoming but each layer uses a different :term:`coordinate reference system (CRS) <CRS>` to record the data. Although QGIS can often render the data correctly, having data sets in multiple CRSs will lead to problems when we begin our processing tasks.
