Discrete and continuous data
============================

When performing an analysis on our land cover raster or converted vector data, but we also have the **Digital elevation model** raster that we would like to analyze. Elevation data sets are continuous, so our **Frequency analysis** process, which counts unique raster values, will not be suitable for this particular task. However, QGIS also comes with another algorithm that is intended for use with continuous data; this algorithm provides minimum, maximum, average and median values, all of which are added to the original vector data set. There is no tabular output equivalent to the statistics tables we have been generating, since all this data can be encoded directly into the vector tables.

.. note:: The graphical modeller does not come with the ability to add conditionals, so we will be creating a copy of our current model and modify it to use a different algorithm.

#. Create a new model named **Zone analysis (continuous)** in the **workshops** group.

#. As with our previous model, we will use the **Image**, **Zones** and **Class** inputs.

#. Add a **Zonal statistics** process that uses **Image** and **Zones** to calculate a new **zonal averages** output.

#. Add a **Dissolve** process to create the single area of interest.

#. Add a **Zonal statistics** process that uses **Image** and the output of the **Dissolve** process to calcualte the **zonal baseline** output.

#. Add a **Dissolve** process that uses **Zones** and **Class** as input (make sure to set :guilabel:`Dissolve all` to :kbd:`No`).

   .. note:: You may wonder why we use a **Dissolve** process here whereas our previous models used a **Singleparts to multipart** process. The reason is that the **Zonal statistics** process is more sensitive to problematic geometries than the **Frequency analysis** process; by dissolving the borders, we ensure that the geometries can be handled when calculating the zonal statistics. So why didn't we use **Dissolve** in our other models? **Dissolve** can be slower than **Singleparts to multipart** since it needs to check for overlapping borders and create new geometric shapes when they do, whereas **Singleparts to multiparts** just blindly merges all polygons into multipolygons.

#. Add a **Zonal statistics** process that uses **Image** and the output of the second **Dissolve** process to calculate the **zonal statistics** output.

      Using **Zonal Statistics**

#. Save the model.

#. Run the new model using **Digital elevation model** as the raster input. As usual save the output files to appropriate locations, rename them and move them to a **Digital elevation model** results group.

#. When styling a continuous data set like our averages layer, we no longer want to assign a random colour to each different value. To accomplish this, rather than using :kbd:`Categorized`, we will use :kbd:`Graduated` with the column ``_mean``.
