OpenGeo Suite is a complete geospatial platform for managing data and building maps and applications across web browsers, desktops, and mobile devices. Built on leading open source geospatial software, OpenGeo Suite has a robust and flexible architecture that enables organizations to reliably manage and publish geospatial data.

OpenGeo Suite includes the following components:

* PostGIS
* GeoServer 
* GeoWebCache
* Mapmeter

GeoServer
---------

GeoServer, the core component of OpenGeo Suite, is a powerful map and feature server for sharing geospatial data using open standards. In addition to being a platform for disseminating spatial data, it also includes powerful processing functionality so that users can request that complex spatial analysis routines be run on a remote server and the results be delivered directly to the client. The Web Processing Service (WPS), as it is known, is an excellent way to concentrate both data and computing on a server to which many users will have access.
