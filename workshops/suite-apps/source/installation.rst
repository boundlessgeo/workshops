Installation 
************

We will be using OpenGeo Suite as our software package, as it all the parts we need to build a web application (PostGIS, GeoServer, OpenLayers) in a single fast installation for Windows, Apple OS/X, and Linux. 

.. note:: 

  The precise directions in this document are for Windows, but for OS/X the installation is largely the same. Once the Suite is installed, the directions for both operating systems should be almost identical.  

#. Find OpenGeo Suite installer for your platform (download from http://boundlessgeo.com/solutions/opengeo-suite/download/). The Windows installer will be named something like  :file:`opengeosuite-4.1.1.exe`, the Mac OSX installer like :file:`opengeosuite-4.1.1.dmg`).  Double click to begin.

#. Enjoy the warm welcome, courtesy of Boundless, then click **Next**.
