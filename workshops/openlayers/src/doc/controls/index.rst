Working With Controls
=====================

In OpenLayers, controls provide a way for users to interact with your map. Some controls have a visual representation while others are invisible to the user. When you create a map with the default options, you are provided with a few visible default controls. These controls allow users to navigate with mouse movements (e.g., drag to pan, double-click to zoom in) and buttons to pan & zoom. In addition there are default controls that specify layer attribution and provide bookmarking of a location.

(Find a full list of available controls in the OpenLayers API documentation:  http://dev.openlayers.org/apidocs/files/OpenLayers-js.html)
