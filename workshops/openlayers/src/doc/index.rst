2013 OpenLayers 2 Workshop
==========================

Welcome to the **OpenLayers Workshop**. This workshop is designed to
give you a comprehensive overview of OpenLayers as a web mapping solution.  The
exercises assume that you have set up a local GeoServer with the workshop
data as described in the :doc:`setup` page.

This workshop is presented as a set of modules. In each module the reader will
perform a set of tasks designed to achieve a specific goal for that module. Each
module builds upon lessons learned in previous modules and is designed to
iteratively build up the reader's knowledge base.
