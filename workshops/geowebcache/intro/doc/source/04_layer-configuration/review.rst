Review
======

* Each layer has its own GeoWebCache settings page.

* The standard GeoServer layer preview is not aware of gridsets and will not necessarily request tiles that align properly. The **Tile Layers** preview should be used to test cached layers.

* GeoWebCache can be configured so that tiles are automatically removed after a certain amount of time.

* When configuring gridsubsets, we can configure which zoom levels will be published and which zoom levels will be cached.

* We can select which styles will be cached for each layer.

* Layer groups can also be cached.
