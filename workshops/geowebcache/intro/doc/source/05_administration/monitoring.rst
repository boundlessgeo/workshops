Monitoring
==========

GeoWebCache home page
---------------------

The GeoWebCache home page (accessible at ``http://localhost:8080/geoserver/gwc``) contains aggregated statistics on the GeoWebCache deployment. The :guilabel:`Cache hit ratio` gives a good measure of how well GeoWebCache is meeting the tile requests from clients.

GeoServer logs
--------------

The GeoServer log files contain messages generated by the embedded GeoWebCache instance. With ``VERBOSE_LOGGING`` enabled in GeoServer, we may see which tiles are being returned by GeoWebCache::

   TRACE [gwc.layer] - --> http-8080-21 returns cache hit for [532, 288, 9]

Messages with the ``[gwc.wms]`` type are generated by integrated GeoWebCache requests.

.. note:: To monitor GeoWebCache log acitivity on a UNIX-like system, the following command may be used: ``tailf geoserver.log | grep gwc``.

.. admonition:: Exercise

   #. Move to the log directory on the command line:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd /var/lib/opengeo/geoserver/logs
         
   #. Use ``tailf geoserver.log | grep gwc`` to watch log activity as you make requests.
