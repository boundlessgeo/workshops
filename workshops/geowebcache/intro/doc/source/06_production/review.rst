Review
======

* To prevent disk usage from growing, we should remove unnecessary cached gridsets, image formats and styles.

* The **PNG8** image format is more space efficient than the default **PNG** format.

* Caching certain geographical areas but not others is an effective strategy for limiting the cache size.

* A **Quota** can be used to stop a cache growing beyond a certain point.

* The quota system can either remove the oldest tile or the least frequently-used tile.

* GeoWebCache has a **REST API**, which allows the administrator to script seeding and other operations.

* The embedded version of GeoWebCache has advantages and disadvantages over the standalone version.
