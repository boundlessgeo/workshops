Considerations
==============

GeoWebCache is an integral part of many instances of OpenGeo Suite. Out of the box, the Suite versions of GeoWebCache are robust and ready to be deployed in a production environment. There are, however, a few issues that should be considered when using GeoWebCache.

Additionally, the `GeoWebCache documentation <http://geowebcache.org/docs/current/production/index.html>`_ has a number of hardware and software recommendations that can benefit both standalone and embedded GeoWebCache.
