======

* The embedded GeoWebCache can be configured through the GeoServer web interface.

* We can disable any of the caching services as well as integrated WMS.

* The **Caching defaults** are only applied to new layers and do not affect existing layers.

* GeoWebCache will create caches for each combination of gridset, image format, and styles.

* The embedded GeoWebCache home page displays statistics about the cache.
