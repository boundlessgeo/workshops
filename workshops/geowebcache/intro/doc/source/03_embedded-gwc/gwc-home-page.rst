   GeoWebCache home page

Some sections to note on this page:

* **Automatically generated demos**: Preconfigured previews of the layer. We will look at this list in a later section.
* **GetCapabilities**: The page has links to the WMS-C, TMS, and WMTS capabilities documents. These are identical to those available from the GeoServer Welcome page.
* **Runtime statistics**: GeoWebCache collects statistics while running and presents them to the user here. These statistics can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the current caches. This will be explored in more detail in a later section.
