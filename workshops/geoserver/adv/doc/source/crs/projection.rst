What is a projection?
---------------------

When talking about geospatial data, one must first define the numbers and units that will be used to notate that data.

On a flat (Cartesian) plane, it is straightforward to talk about "where" something is. Each point or vertex can be denoted by two ordinates (often referred to as **x** and **y**). The distance between two points can be easily calculated and understood.

   Points on the Cartesian plane

Things get more complicated when we start dealing with the Earth (or any non-flat surface), and that is what we are concerned with when dealing with geospatial data.

Most everyone is familiar with latitude and longitude, the two ordinates that make up the location of a point on the globe. Latitude and longitude have units of degrees. Like x/y coordinates of the Cartesian plane, each coordinate describes a unique location. Unlike the Cartesian plane though, the unit of degrees does not describe a fixed distance. This can be most easily seen in the following graphic, where the "rectangles" of all different sizes each represent one square degree.

All this is mentioned to bring up the point that it is not trivial to translate round surfaces to the flat plane, but that is exactly what is needed when working in mapping, as the flat plane is the computer screen or printed page. The process of moving from round surface to flat plane is called "projection". More formally:

*A map projection is a systematic transformation of the latitudes and longitudes of locations on the surface of a sphere or an ellipsoid into locations on a plane.*

There are many different ways to project a round surface on to the plane. Here are some examples:

    Some map projections (these images and others on this page courtesy of `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection>`_)

Each projection has different considerations, mainly involving distortion. There will be some kind of distortion in every projection; the only question is what is distorted and to what extent. For example, certain projections, such as Albers or Sinusoidal, preserve the area of shapes, while projections such as Mercator or stereographic (called "conformal" projections, preserve angles locally. Other projections, such as the Buckminster Fuller Dymaxion map, are "compromise projections" that preserve some proportion of area, angle, shape, or scale.

Some projections are valid for only a certain area, and not for the entire globe. For example, a rectilinear (gnomonic) projection can only show half the globe.

The Mercator projection may be the best known projection outside of professional circles, though it is as well known for its distortions and inaccuracies as much as for its utility (the common complaint being that Greenland is seen to be as big as Africa, despite being 1/14 the size).

.. note:: Technically, the Earth's surface is not a sphere, but a spheroid (actually an oblate spheroid). Such distinctions are beyond the scope of this workshop.

Datums
------

There is much more to the discussion than just porjecting a sphere onto a plane.

The Earth's is not even a regular oblate spheroid at all. It has deviations (pits and hills) that need to be taken into account when calculating how to project the surface on to the flat plane.

While necessarily an approximation, this is the role of the *datum*. A datum is the definition of how to model the deviations of the ideal surface.

For example, one common datum in use is `WGS84 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System>`_ used in GPS systems, while two others are `NAD27/NAD83 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Datum>`_. The numbers refer to the year in which the standard was published. All datums are approximations that are more accurate for different purposes.

All CRSs are associated with a datum.

GeoServer and projections
-------------------------

GeoServer has support for a large number of projections (around 5,000). In GeoServer, they are referred to as "spatial reference systems" (SRS) or "coordinate reference systems" (CRS). The use of SRS versus CRS is inconsistent, but they are both referring to the same thing.

Typically, CRSs are noted in the form of "EPSG:####", where "####" is a numerical code. The "EPSG" prefix refers to the European Petroleum Survey Group, a now-defunct entity that was instrumental in cataloging different CRSs.

To see what CRSs GeoServer supports, there is a demo in the web interface that displays a list of all the CRSs as well as their definitions.

Click the :guilabel:`Demos` link just as we did before for the Demo Request Builder. In the list that follows, click :guilabel:`SRS List`.

The full list of projections will be displayed.

   All SRSs supported by GeoServer

You can click on any entry, or use the search box to filter the list by keyword or number. Enter "yukon" in the search box and press Enter. The list will be filtered down to two options: 3578 and 3579.

.. figure:: img/srs_listfiltered.png

   Filtered list of SRSs

Click :guilabel:`3578`. You will see details about this CRS, including its Well Known Text (WKT) definition. This is the formal definition of the CRS, and includes all information necessary to process geospatial data to and from this CRS. You will also see a map of the area of validity for that CRS.

GeoServer and reprojection
--------------------------

Data is stored in a particular CRS. However, GeoServer is able to leverage its database of CRSs and reproject data dynamically. So while a particular layer may be stored in one CRS, it is possible to make a request for data in any CRS.

For example, let's request some data to be reprojected. For simplicity, we'll use the WMS Reflector, as it provides the simplest way to craft WMS requests.

Execute this request::

  http://suite.opengeo.org/geoserver/wms/reflect?layers=usa:states

This will return an image of the usa:states layer over its full extent with all default options. The default CRS is EPSG:4326.

.. figure:: img/usastates_4326.png

   The usa:states layer in EPSG:4326

Now try the following request::

  http://suite.opengeo.org/geoserver/wms/reflect?layers=usa:states&srs=EPSG:3700

This returns the same data but in EPSG:3700, or "Wisconsin South (ftUS)".

.. figure:: img/usastates_3700.png

   The usa:states layer in EPSG:3700

GeoServer has dynamically reprojected the data during the request execution. No data was or is ever stored in EPSG:3700. Note that the farther away from the target area, the more "warped" the display becomes. This is a visual representation of the trade-off between accuracy and large-scale. This would certianly not be a good CRS to use when looking at Asia!

Try other EPSG codes to see how the output changes. Should you get a blank image, it just means that the CRS is not valid for that area.

Dynamic reprojection allows for a great deal of flexibility, as the same data need not be stored in multiple CRSs. However, there is a cost involved in reprojection, in that it requires extra processing time. With small data sets this is negligible, but for larger, more complex situations, the processing time can be prohibitive.

For this reason, we recommended that you **store your data in the CRS in which it will be accessed most frequently**. If you need to transform your data to this CRS, use a spatial database function such as `ST_Transform <http://www.postgis.org/docs/ST_Transform.html>`_ in PostGIS. 

.. note:: Utilizing tile caching is one option that shifts the processing time away from when the tiles are requested, but the actual rendering of tiles will still be slower than in the native CRS.
