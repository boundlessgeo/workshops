Installing the OpenGeo Suite
============================

In this section you will install the OpenGeo Suite on your system. This will provide everything necessary to get started with GeoServer.

GeoServer, being a Java servlet, typically requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) as well as a servlet container in order to function. Both a JRE and a servlet container are included with the OpenGeo Suite, so separate installation is not needed here.

The OpenGeo Suite executable file is located on your desktop in the :file:`software` folder. Double click to start the installation process.
