Installing GeoServer
====================

In this section, we will install GeoServer. For the purposes of this workshop, we will be using the OpenGeo Suite—of which GeoServer is a primary component—in order to facilitate setup and configuration.

The OpenGeo Suite is free and open source, and is `available for download from OpenGeo <http://opengeo.org/products/suite/>`_.
