Google Earth
============

Google Earth is a powerful 3D map viewer. GeoServer integrates with Google Earth by providing native :term:`KML` output, allowing any layer served by GeoServer to be loaded into Google Earth. In addition, there are additional visualization features that are made possible through Google Earth, such as legends, filters, and extrudes.

In this section, you will see how Google Earth can be used as a client for viewing and interacting with GeoServer.
