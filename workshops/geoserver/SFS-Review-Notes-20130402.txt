SFS Slide / Landslide review notes and thoughts 2013-04-02
(for discussion with Mike P. soon~ish)

- naturally we need more/some design on the slides (across our entire company doc suite)
- need more spacing / formatting (bullets?) in slide notes
- would really like to be able to modularize RST files
-- managability & readability [[[]]] WYSIWYG RST editor?
-- reusability
- style conventions in notes for talking script / actions / steps / notes etc.
- common voice? (How you say/type things isn't how I speak, and VV!!!)
