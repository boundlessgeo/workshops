Intro to GeoServer: Attendee worksheet
======================================

GeoServer is an open source software server written in ________________________ that allows users to share and edit ________________________   ________________________.

Designed for interoperability, it publishes data from any major spatial data source using ________________________   ________________________.

Section 2: GeoServer web interface
----------------------------------

Most GeoServer configuration can be done through your ________________________.

The default location of the GeoServer web admin interface is http://________________________________.

The ________________________   ________________________ allows you easily view layers currently served by GeoServer through OpenLayers, GeoExplorer, and other clients.

GeoServer with the Layer Importer extension allows for uploading of ________________________ files that contain geospatial information.

Section 3: Overview
-------------------

A web mapping server is designed specifically toward the transfer of ________________________   ________________________.

GeoServer implements standard open web protocols established by the ________________________   ________________________   ________________________ .

The _______________________   ________________________   ________________________ is a standard protocol for serving georeferenced map images generated by a map server.

The Web Map Service source material can be either ________________________ or ________________________ data, or a combination of the two.

A request for information about the server itself is called a ________________________ request.

The _______________________   ________________________   ________________________ is a standard protocol for serving geographic feature data.

The Web Feature Service is what allows you to see the ________________________   ________________________ of the map.

The GetFeature response contains not only the geographic features, but also its ________________________.

WFS output can include not only GML and JSON, but also a ZIPped ________________________ .

The raster analog to the Web Feature Service is the ________________________   ________________________   ________________________.

The protocol that allows for geospatial analysis is known as the ________________________   ________________________   ________________________.

A ________________________ is the name for a notional container for grouping similar data together. It is sometimes referred to as a ________________________.

Workspaces are usually denoted by a ________________________ instead of the full URI.

A ________________________ is the name for a container of geographic data. It refers to a specific data source, be it a shapefile, database, or any other data source that GeoServer supports.

A ________________________ is a collection of geospatial features or a coverage. It corresponds to a table or view from a database, or an individual file.

A ________________________   ________________________ is a collection of layers, which can be requested using a single ________________________ request.

A ________________________ is a visualization directive for rendering geographic data.

Section 4: Working with data
----------------------------

The first step in data loading is usually to create a ________________________ .

When loading a shapefile, the first step is to add it as a ________________________ and then publish the ________________________ .

A layer inherits the store's ________________________ .

When publishing a layer the two settings that need to be verified are the ________________________ and ________________________   ________________________.

Clicking on a feature in the Layer Preview shows information about that feature's ________________________ .

A GeoTIFF, like a shapefile, is a store that contains a single ________________________ .

By default, the Layer Importer can import both ________________________ files and ________________________ tables.

With appropriate extensions added, the Layer Importer can also import ________________________   ________________________ and ________________________    ________________________ tables.

GeoServer also includes a ________________________   ________________________ for programmatically loading and configuring layers.

In a layer group, the first listed layer is drawn ________________________ and therefore will appear ________________________ the other drawn layers.

Section 5: Styling
------------------

Geospatial data has no inherent ________________________ .

Styling applies to the Web ________________________ Service only.

GeoServer uses the ________________________   ________________________   ________________________ markup language to describe layer styling.

SLD is an ________________________ -based markup language.

A FeatureTypeStyle is a ________________________ of styling Rules.

The Rules in the first FeatureTypeStyle in an SLD file will be interpreted ________________________ .

A Rule is a single ________________________ directive.

There are five types of Symbolizers: ________________________ , ________________________ , ________________________ , ________________________ , and ________________________ .

True or False: There can be only one Symbolizer in a rule: ________________________ .

When manually loading a layer, GeoServer will assign a generic ________________________ based on the layer's geometry.

The Layer Importer will generate a ________________________ style for a given layer.

It is important to ________________________ your SLDs after making any changes to them to ensure that your layers continue to display properly.

GeoExplorer allows you to edit styles ________________________ .

Section 6: Google Earth
-----------------------

Google Earth can be used as a map ________________________ .

GeoServer can output data in ________________________ format so that Google Earth can load it.

Loading a layer as a ________________________   ________________________ allows for dynamic refreshing of the display in Google Earth.

The legend on a Google Earth display is generated from the ________________________ tag(s) in the SLD.

________________________ filtering allows you to create a display filter based on attribute values.

The determination on whether to render features as an image or as vectors is called ________________________ and the parameter is called ________________________ .

Extrudes are also known as "________________________ D" display.

GeoServer uses ________________________ templates saved in the data directory in order to enable extruded features.
