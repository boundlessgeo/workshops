Installing GeoServer
====================

In this section, we will install GeoServer.

For the purposes of this workshop, we will be using OpenGeo Suite (of which GeoServer is a primary component) in order to facilitate setup and configuration.

OpenGeo Suite is a complete web-based geospatial software stack. In this package, the applications contained are: 

* **PostGIS** - A spatially enabled object-relational database.
* **GeoServer** - A software server for loading and sharing geospatial data.
* **GeoWebCache** - A tile cache server that accelerates the serving of maps (built into GeoServer).
* **OpenLayers** - A browser-based mapping framework
