QGIS Sample Workflow 1
======================

This section provides a sample workflow using the QGIS GeoGig plugin that we introduced earlier. For our first example we will replicate the previous 'centralized' workflow done on the command line. Again we have a small GIS department with GIS analysts who need to work on the data simultaneously and a single data manager who serves as the 'gatekeeper' by reviewing all changes before they enter the product. We will use Alice and Bob as our GIS analysts again, in charge of **review** and **updates** respectively.
