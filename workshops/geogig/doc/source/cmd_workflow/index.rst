Command Line Sample workflow
============================

This section introduces a command line workflow that would be suitable for a small GIS department with a GIS analysts who need to work on the data simultaneously and a single data manager who serves as the 'gatekeeper' by reviewing all changes before they enter the product.

We will be using the concepts we introduced so far in the workshop (and a couple of new ones too) to demonstrate this workflow.
